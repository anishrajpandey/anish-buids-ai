Welcome to **anish-builds-ai**, the personal AI and machine learning project hub of Anish Raj Pandey.

This repository is a living, breathing record of my journey building AI systemsâ€”from foundational neural networks to large language models, MLOps pipelines, and cutting-edge generative AI agents.

Here, you'll find:  
- Hands-on projects, from scratch implementations to production-grade apps  
- Notes and insights from top AI books, courses, and tutorials  
- Code demos, experiments, and notebooks to help reinforce concepts  
- Deployment workflows and MLOps best practices  
- Explorations into AI agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and AI engineering  

This repo is both my learning playground and professional portfolio, designed to showcase real, runnable AI projects that demonstrate deep understanding and practical skills.

Feel free to explore, learn alongside me, or reach out for collaborations.
